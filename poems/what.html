				I was hired by a person in a dark red robe<br>

				to guard a bag of black and silver gears<br>

				until some time in the future <br>

				when I have to return the bag<br><br>

				<i>these gears will try very hard to escape<br>

				but you mustn't let them, no matter what</i><br>

				my hiring agent said<br> 

				resting his thumbs on the rope at his waist<br><br>

				<i>if you do, you will no longer qualify<br>

				for employee benefits</i><br><br>

				for several days <br>

				this was an easy job<br>

				and then a portal made of lighting and fog<br>

				opened up in the corner of my office<br><br>

				a person who looked very much like me<br>

				stepped through the portal and said<br>

				<i>listen to me very carefully</i><br><br>

				I could tell that this person was the future me<br>

				by the increased muscle tone and confidence<br>

				and I looked forward to making people listen<br>

				to what I needed to say<br><br>

				<i>I need a single gear from that bag,</i> Future Me said<br>

				<i>and I can't tell you why but you have to trust me<br>

				and by me I mean yourself you should trust yourself</i><br><br>	

				do you love me <span class='spacer'></span>I asked my future self<br><br>

				<i>what?</i><br><br> 

				do you<br>

				love me <span class='spacer'></span> as in do you love who you used to be<br><br>

				<i>look, if you don't believe in me we are both doomed</i><br><br>

				but I could lose my employee benefits<br>

				what if I get cancer<br><br>

				<i>you won't</i>
