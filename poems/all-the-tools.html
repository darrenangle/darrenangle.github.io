			<p class='prose-poem'>
				a small man is hanging over the edge of a railroad track<br>
				watching a mouse with a band-aid in its mouth<br>
				and laughing a small laugh<br><br>

				a large man with a beard<br>
				that appears to be made of mice and band-aids<br>
				approaches the smaller man and says<br><br>

				<i>I don't know why you're laughing<br>
					that'll be you in thirteen years</i><br><br>

				he jumps down onto the tracks<br>
				collects the mouse into his beard<br>
				and bursts into shadow
