				he had this love <br>
				and he couldn't do anything <br>
				about this love <br>
				so he got drunk <br>
				and did a drunk backflip <br>
				over a staircase railing <br>
				a combination <br>
				of sweet mangling <br>
				and skull <br>
				he'd say <i>don't act <br>
				like you don't know</i> <br>
				sprinting shirtless <br>
				at a patch of mud <br>
				in a single bowling shoe <br>
				uneven flabs <br>
				swinging from rib bone <br>
				loose buttons <br>
				he'd slide across the mud <br>
				one-legged and smooth it <br>
				before he crumpled <br>
				conviction rippling <br>
				through the mess <i>yeah <br>
				I repeat </i> and if you ask him where <br>
				you get that kind of love <br>
				he'd say he was biking downhill <br>
				full blast through the woods <br>
				eyes on the creek <br>
				instead of the path <br>
				and came up on a swirl of gnats <br>
				his throat a wide o <br>
				singing his dumb song <br>
				one snagged so far in <br>
				he had to swallow <br>
				or get pocked up <br>
				with burrs <br>
				and stiff bristles <br>
				what-iffery and what <br>
				would have been <br>
